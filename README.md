For this assignment, you will be developing PHP/PDO code for a page or set of pages that fulfill(s) the requirements found below.

Using your personal database on the MariaDB server (the one that has your zid as its name), create the tables from the SQL SELECT slides (<strong>S</strong>, <strong>SP</strong>, <strong>P</strong>) and make sure they contain the data in the rows shown in the slides (before adding the extra rows later). None of the columns should be allowed to be NULL. Data types are not explicitly specified in the tables from the slides, so feel free to choose any that would work to store the data of the types shown.
